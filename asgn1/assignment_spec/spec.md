## Overview
Anchor down Commodore fans! Pull out your Black and Gold 'cause Vandy sports are going strong. Football, Soccer, Basketball, and of course our NCAA Champion Baseball are all coming your way this 2014-15 season. Most fans find it difficult to keep the schedules straight, so we present the VandySports App. With data coming primarily from the Vanderbilt Athletics website (http://www.vucommodores.com/), the VandySports App provides a detailed schedule for each of our teams. 

In the assignment, you will provide an app that allows a fan to quickly find out what sports are happening when. It will be able to access the Vanderbilt schedules and show the schedules of your favorite teams or simply what sports are happening today. Let's help the Vandy nation follow the Commodores easily and efficiently, and of course ANCHOR DOWN!!!!!!
